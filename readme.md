Hello.
to run this project you will need Node.js installed in your system.

First Open your terminal and run the following command:

cd backend

npm run dev

after running these 3 commands it will start the backend of the project.

to see if the api calls are working properly or not Use Postman.

In the backend i have marked which part you will have to understand. raz for rahmin and hjb for hasna. the parts that are marked, you will have to memorize them and you will have to learn how to manipulate them. Use chatgpt for help.
Or ask me in person.

the frontend is not yet finished. I will send the frontend part later.
for now get familiarized with the backend part. there will be no changes in the backend part. Remember, everything in the backend part works perfectly. if you want to do testing by modifying the code, then make a copy of what i have given then experiment on it.
